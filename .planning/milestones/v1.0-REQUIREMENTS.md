# Requirements: Procedural Integrity Score Dashboard

**Defined:** 2026-02-20
**Core Value:** Apply transparent, defensible procedural compliance scoring to IIJA federal infrastructure spending to help watchdog audiences identify potential issues and benchmark project integrity.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Data Integration

- [x] **DATA-01**: Connect to USASpending.gov API v2 endpoints for award data
- [x] **DATA-02**: Implement caching layer to handle API rate limits (~5K requests/day)
- [x] **DATA-03**: Sync IIJA-specific awards (filter by funding agency, assistance type)
- [x] **DATA-04**: Display data currency indicator ("Data as of [date]")
- [x] **DATA-05**: Handle API errors gracefully with user feedback

### Search & Filtering

- [x] **FILT-01**: Keyword search across project names, descriptions
- [x] **FILT-02**: Filter by US state/territory
- [x] **FILT-03**: Filter by federal agency (DOE, DOT, EPA, etc.)
- [x] **FILT-04**: Filter by project category (transportation, broadband, clean energy)
- [x] **FILT-05**: Combine multiple filters (AND logic)

### Data Display

- [x] **TABL-01**: Paginated data table showing projects with key fields
- [x] **TABL-02**: Server-side pagination for large datasets (>10K rows)
- [x] **TABL-03**: Sort by columns (amount, date, score)
- [x] **TABL-04**: Summary metrics dashboard (total spending, project counts)
- [x] **TABL-05**: Responsive design for mobile access

### Procedural Compliance Scoring

- [x] **SCR-01**: Implement scoring engine with defined rule set
- [x] **SCR-02**: Score based on: environmental review timing, competitive bidding window, modification authorization
- [x] **SCR-03**: Calculate weighted composite score per project
- [x] **SCR-04**: Display score prominently on each project row
- [x] **SCR-05**: Document scoring methodology with regulatory citations (2 CFR 200, Build America Buy America, Davis-Bacon)

### Detailed Project View

- [x] **PROJ-01**: Individual project detail pages
- [x] **PROJ-02**: Show score breakdown by compliance category
- [x] **PROJ-03**: Display project timeline and key dates
- [x] **PROJ-04**: Link to source data on USASpending.gov

### Lead Generation

- [x] **LEAD-01**: Email capture form for detailed project reports
- [x] **LEAD-02**: Magic link authentication via Supabase Auth
- [x] **LEAD-03**: Generate PDF report for gated download
- [x] **LEAD-04**: Store leads in Supabase with role/organization fields

### Documentation

- [x] **DOC-01**: Public-facing methodology explainer page
- [x] **DOC-02**: FAQ section addressing scoring questions
- [x] **DOC-03**: Data sources and update frequency page

### Hardening & Analytics

- [x] **HARD-01**: Priority journeys complete (Explore → Detail → Lead capture; Content → Newsletter signup; Self-assessment → Results → Lead capture)
- [x] **HARD-02**: Analytics events recorded for each priority journey step
- [x] **HARD-03**: User-facing flows have no dead actions and meet production-ready polish
- [x] **HARD-04**: Journey regression checks exist for critical routes and CTAs

### Stabilization & Deployment

- [x] **STAB-01**: Staging + production release workflow with manual approval and blue/green promotion
- [x] **STAB-02**: Error/failed request monitoring with warning/critical alerts to email + Slack
- [x] **STAB-03**: Reliability safeguards (health checks, rollback trigger, per-IP rate limiting)
- [x] **STAB-04**: Environment/config hardening (secret storage, startup validation, build/test gates, edge/runtime config)

### Production Hardening & Automation

- [x] **PROD-01**: Form functionality (newsletter, lead capture) migration to client-side Supabase client for static host compatibility
- [x] **PROD-02**: Automated data-driven insights generation via scheduled GitHub Actions using standalone scripts
- [x] **PROD-03**: Secure administrative access and RLS policies for client-side updates of insights and other restricted tables
- [x] **PROD-04**: Session restoration and context-aware redirection via dedicated auth callback for static site authentication

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Visualization

- **VIZ-01**: Timeline visualization (Gantt-style) of project phases
- **VIZ-02**: Interactive map view of projects by location
- **VIZ-03**: Agency comparison charts

### Self-Assessment

- **SELF-01**: Form wizard for entities to input own project data
- **SELF-02**: Private compliance score calculation
- **SELF-03**: Benchmark comparison against public data

### Content

- **CONT-01**: Automated finding alerts (e.g., "X% of projects have timing violations")
- **CONT-02**: Export to CSV/Excel

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time API polling | USASpending updates monthly; unnecessary complexity |
| User accounts with passwords | Adds friction; email magic link sufficient |
| Mobile app | Over-engineering for 6-8 week timeline |
| Social sharing | Not aligned with B2B/government audience |
| Commenting/user content | Requires moderation, off-topic |
| AI chatbot | Hallucination risk with compliance data |
| Dark mode | Nice-to-have, defer to v2 |
| Multi-language support | US-focused product |
