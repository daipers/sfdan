**Gathered:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Expand and finalize product functionality after Phase 7 so the system is fully functional end-to-end. This phase tightens existing capabilities and validates priority journeys without adding new features.

## Implementation Decisions

### Fully functional definition
- Priority journeys must be complete: Explore → Detail → Lead capture; Explore → Content → Newsletter signup; Self-assessment → Results → Lead capture
- Minimum acceptable polish: Production-ready UI/UX
- Bulletproof standard applies to everything user-facing
- Completion bar: all priority journeys work without manual intervention, zero P0 bugs, and metrics/analytics in place

### Claude's Discretion
