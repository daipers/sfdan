<objective>
Create public documentation pages: methodology explainer, FAQ section, and data sources explanation.

Purpose: Help users understand how scores are calculated, answer common questions, and understand data provenance.
Output: Three documentation pages accessible from navigation

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhance methodology page</name>
  <files>src/app/methodology/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Expand existing methodology page with comprehensive scoring explanation:
    - Overview: What procedural compliance scoring measures
    - Three components explained:
      1. Environmental Review Timing (40% weight) - NEPA timeline compliance
      2. Competitive Bidding (35% weight) - Competition requirements under 2 CFR 200
      3. Modification Authorization (25% weight) - Change order approval process
    - Regulatory citations for each component (2 CFR 200, Build America Buy America, Davis-Bacon)
    - Score calculation formula
    - What low scores indicate and common causes
    - Limitations and caveats
    - Use clear headings, bullet points, and visual hierarchy

    Methodology page explains all three scoring components with citations
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
<name>Task 2: Create FAQ page</name>
<files>src/app/faq/page.tsx</files>
<action>
    Create FAQ page at src/app/faq/page.tsx:
    - Accordion-style questions and answers
    - Questions to address:
      1. What is the Procedural Integrity Score?
      2. How is the score calculated?
      3. What do the colors mean? (green/yellow/red)
      4. Where does the data come from?
      5. How often is the data updated?
      6. Can I request a score for my project?
      7. What does "Insufficient Data" mean?
      8. How can I use this for journalism?
      9. Is this an official government tool?
      10. How can I report an issue with a score?
    - Expand first question by default
    - Smooth expand/collapse animations
    - Clean, readable typography

<name>Task 4: Add documentation links to navigation</name>
<files>src/components/Navigation.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Update Navigation component to include links to documentation:
    - Add Methodology link
    - Add FAQ link
    - Add Data Sources link
    - Place in header or footer
    - Use consistent styling with existing nav links
