| Plan | None yet |
| Status | Ready for planning |
| Progress | 0% |

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|

| Coverage | 100% |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made
- **Phase structure:** 4 phases (quick depth: 3-5)
- **Phase 1:** Foundation & Data Ingestion (DATA-01 to DATA-05)
- **Phase 2:** Scoring Engine (SCR-01 to SCR-05) - core differentiator
- **Phase 3:** Dashboard & Search (FILT + TABL = 10 requirements)
- **Phase 4:** Details & Lead Gen (PROJ + LEAD + DOC = 11 requirements)

### Key Dependencies
- USASpending.gov API v2 - primary data source
- Supabase - backend storage and auth
- Scoring methodology must be defensible (2 CFR 200, Build America Buy America)

### Research Flags
- Phase 2 (Scoring Engine): May need deeper research on regulatory citations

### Notes
- Timeline: 6-8 weeks
- Audience: Journalists, municipal finance officers, IG community
- Mode: YOLO (auto-approve workflow)

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** Roadmap created
**Next action:** `/gsd-plan-phase 1` to start planning Phase 1
